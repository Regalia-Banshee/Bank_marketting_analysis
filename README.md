üè¶ Bank Term Deposit Subscription Prediction
This project aims to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit policy using bank marketing data. It leverages XGBoost, pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn for machine learning, and uses SQL for exploratory data analysis (EDA). Visualizations were created with matplotlib and seaborn.

üîç Problem Statement
Banks often run marketing campaigns to encourage customers to subscribe to term deposit schemes. This project builds a predictive model that can help identify likely subscribers based on historical customer and campaign data.
